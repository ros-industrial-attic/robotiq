Module baseRobotiq2FGripper: defines a base class for handling command and status of the Robotiq 2F gripper.

After being instanciated, a 'client' member must be added to the object. This client depends on the communication protocol used by the Gripper. As an example, the ROS node 'Robotiq2FGripperTcpNode.py' instanciate a robotiqbaseRobotiq2FGripper and adds a client defined in the module comModbusTcp.
