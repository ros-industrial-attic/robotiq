"""@package docstring
ROS node for controling a Robotiq 2F gripper using the Modbus RTU protocol.

The script takes as an argument the IP address of the gripper. It initializes a baseRobotiq2FGripper object and adds a comModbusTcp client to it. It then loops forever, reading the gripper status and updating its command. The gripper status is published on the 'Robotiq2FGripperRobotInput' topic using the 'Robotiq2FGripper_robot_input' msg type. The node subscribes to the 'Robotiq2FGripperRobotOutput' topic for new commands using the 'Robotiq2FGripper_robot_output' msg type. Examples are provided to control the gripper (Robotiq2FGripperSimpleController.py) and interpreting its status (Robotiq2FGripperStatusListener.py).
