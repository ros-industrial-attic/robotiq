Module baseSModel: defines a base class for handling command and status of the Robotiq S-Model gripper. 

After being instanciated, a 'client' member must be added to the object. This client depends on the communication protocol used by the Gripper. As an example, the ROS node 'SModelTcpNode.py' instanciate a robotiqBaseSModel and adds a client defined in the module comModbusTcp.
