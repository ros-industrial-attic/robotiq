"""@package docstring
Command-line interface for sending simple commands to a ROS node controlling a 3F gripper gripper.

This serves as an example for publishing messages on the 'Robotiq3FGripperRobotOutput' topic using the 'Robotiq3FGripper_robot_output' msg type for sending commands to a 3F gripper gripper. In this example, only the simple control mode is implemented. For using the advanced control mode, please refer to the Robotiq support website (support.robotiq.com).
